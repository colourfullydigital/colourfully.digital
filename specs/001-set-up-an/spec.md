## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a website visitor, I want to access a fast, modern website with a compelling home page that introduces the site/company, a dedicated blog section for reading articles, and interactive forms for communication, while content creators can manage all content and forms through a user-friendly CMS interface.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a visitor accesses the website, **When** they navigate to the homepage, **Then** they should see an engaging introduction, key site information, and clear navigation to other sections including the blog
2. **Given** a visitor wants to read blog content, **When** they navigate to the blog section, **Then** they should see a dedicated blog landing page with a list of published blog posts, categories, and search/filter options
3. **Given** a visitor clicks on a blog post, **When** the post page loads, **Then** they should see the full article content with proper formatting, images, and metadata
4. **Given** a visitor wants to contact or interact, **When** they access a form, **Then** they should be able to fill out and submit information with proper validation and feedback
5. **Given** a content creator accesses Sanity Studio, **When** they manage content, **Then** they should be able to edit homepage content, create/edit blog posts, and configure forms
6. **Given** a content creator publishes content in Sanity, **When** the website regenerates, **Then** all changes should appear on the live website
7. **Given** a visitor accesses the website on mobile, **When** browsing any section, **Then** the site should be fully responsive and performant

### Edge Cases
- What happens when there are no published blog posts on the blog landing page?
- How does the system handle large images or media files?
- What occurs if Sanity.io is temporarily unavailable?
- How are draft posts handled vs published posts?
- What happens when a form submission fails or times out?
- How are spam submissions prevented on forms?
- What occurs if required form fields are missing validation?
